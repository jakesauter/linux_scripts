nightmode -- the first script that I have been really proud of in a while, allows manual ajustment of blue light filter
             and "gamma value", allowing for brightness of the screen to be software-controlled to a point

fan -- a script that I use to control my fan speed on my lenovo thinpad x1 carbon 3rd gen laptop

hdmi-on --  a script that I used to use (and later automated to automattically) change my display settings when my
            hdmi cable was plugged in 
            
hdmi-off -- the same script as hdmi-on, though instead switched my monitor settings back
