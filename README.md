[**rosalind.py**](files/rosalind.py) -- A python script that I am currently using to track my progress on the [Rosalind.info](wwww.rosalind.info) python bioinformatics site

[**fan**](files/fan) -- a script that I use to control my fan speed on my lenovo thinpad x1 carbon 3rd gen laptop

[**hdmi-on**](files/hdmi-on) --  a script that I used to use (and later automated to automattically) change my display settings when my
            hdmi cable was plugged in 
            
[**hdmi-off**](files/hdmi-off) -- the same script as hdmi-on, though instead switched my monitor settings back
